Sawyer grew up riding around on various bmx bikes. Building ramps and jumping was his jam for a long time.

Fast forward many years to college, he bought his first mountain bike. A hard tail Giant Rincon which he would ride around on the Ben Geren trails in Fort Smith Arkansas.

Over time, he rode less and less and eventually moved to Phoenix Arizona where he didn't really ride at all...

Until he began working for Solera Health who was sponsoring the Tour de Cure. Sawyer likes a good challenge, so he decided to buy a road bike (Trek Domane) and do the 50 mile ride. This seemed huge at the time and unimaginably difficult. However, he trained a bit and was able to pretty easily complete the ride.

Covid-19 hit about the time Sawyer began riding on the Velo group rides. This group of riders was instrumental in teaching him how to ride in groups and keep his bike mechanically sound. South Mountain became a staple weekend rides due to being it being one of the only places in Phoenix with a sustained climb.

Eventually, Sawyer moved to Washington where he continued to road bike in the Issaquah area. Lake Sammamish and Mercer Island were favorite routes.

Currently, Sawyer resides in North Bend and has converted to riding mostly gravel trails. Sometimes road when it is necessary to get to the gravel trails. He is quite content with his Canyon Grail.

Some noteworthy events Sawyer has completed in the past:

- Tour de Cure
- Gran Fondo Leavenworth
- Gran Fondo Ellensburg
- Cascadia Super Gravel
- Unbound
- Chilly Hilly
- Tour de Tucson
