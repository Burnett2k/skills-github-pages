## 4/19/2025 - Cascadia Super Gravel üèÅ

Sawyer's first event of the year. CSG will be the first fitness test after 3 months of solid training and a return to fitness. The 13k of elevation gain and potentially inclement weather make this a very tough and unpredictable ride.

Summary: Sawyer started off strong until getting a puncture in front tire at mile 10. After plugging front, the rear tire also punctured at mile 25. Plug wasn't holding, so a tube was installed. Tube eventually flatted after 10 miles. Ran out of replacement tubes. Luckily a good samaritan gave Sawyer a TPU tube which allowed him to complete the race on. Sawyer is happy with his on-bike performance for this one, but not happy about the punctures and difficulty in managing them. Around 2 hours were spent on bike maintenance, which means time could have been theoretically 90 minutes faster if punctures didn't occur or they were fixed more rapidly. Sawyer plans to switch from WTB venture tires to Maxxis Ramblers for future events. Sawyer ended at 53 / 72 riders. Not very impressive at all, but the mechanicals slowed him down substantially. He believes he could've gotten closer to an 8 hour finish if mechanicals weren't an issue.

## 5/31/2025 - Unbound üèÅ

Sawyer entered the the Unbound 200 lottery on a whim after a few acquaintances in his home town mentioned going. A few months later, he received the exciting and stressful news that he got in! This meant he needed to start training ASAP and figure out how he would survive his longest ride ever. Not only was this his longest ride, but it was also on rough terrain known for causing frequent flats and other mechanical issues. TrainerRoad was started at the beginning of the year to aid in training.

Summary: Sawyer had a great day with no mechanicals. His Maxxis Ramblers handled the terrain perfectly. The weather was dry and hot which kept the mud to a minimum. Starting out, Sawyer's strategy was to push a bit harder so he could sit in with a fast group and get ahead as much as possible. His goal was to "beat the sun" which meant he had until about 8:15 pm to complete the race. To be in by roughly 8pm, it would require riding the 202 mile race in about 14 hours. Sawyer was able to execute on his plan successfully, and by the time he made it to aid station 1 at mile ~70, he was already about 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Throughout the day, Sawyer maintained this time lead and allowed himself ample breaks to ensure success. By the final aid station at mile ~150, Sawyer realized he had enough fitness to push it a bit harder. He began upping the pace and passing many people on his way to the finish. He ended up completing the race in 13:12:14 putting him at 273 / 953 riders.

## 7/19/2025 - The GRiT

The GRiT ride is right up the road from me in Snoqualmie Pass. Last year I did the pre-ride and was surprised at how challenging some of the gravel is. Lots of chunk!

I will be doing the GRiT this year for fun, and because I've never done it before. It will be pretty hot.
